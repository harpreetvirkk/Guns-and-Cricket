                <p>Pakistan’s ODI wins have been on a constant dipping spree for the last decade, despite the 180-run sweep last summer, that remains a stinging sore for the Indians. Tensed bilateral ties, a weak bureaucracy and a notoriously bad reputation cost them the home-ground advantage.
                </p>
                <p>The India-Pakistan arch-rivalry has been a skirmish of identity and validation. The sentiments attached with every  The Indian team has had no shortage of neither support nor validation. Turns out, that India’s winning streak is fairly a modern phenomenon: Influenced heavily by what happens across the barbed wires and outside the setting of billions of Indians and Pakistanis glued to their TV screens.
                </p>
                <p>For Pakistan, the sheen of the glorious 15 years of ODI dominance, is now on the verge of wiping out of existence. Here’s why.
                </p>
                <p>Between 1985 and 2005, Pakistan maintained a winning streak of 52 matches out of a total of 80 matches. What is interesting though, is that the organisation of these matches have been fairly scattered, spiking to a top of ten matches played in 1997 and fairly fluctuating around the same ballpark. 
                </p>
                <p>The turn of the century saw a series of political speculations and ceasefire violations that strained bilateral ties, and reflected onto the ODIs. The years that stand out in the fluctuations are 1989-90, 2000-2004, 2008 and onwards. 
                </p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Amidst spot-fixing accusations in 2010, Pakistan managed to keep its tab of wins marginally higher than India. The lack of a homeground does not have any perceivable effect on Pakistan’s performance until the last decade. With the number of ODIs reduced, Pakistani cricket has been losing out on its morale. It lost a host of commitments from countries who were to engage in test series with Pakistan. Lack of funding and a marred public image of the team and its players seems to have taken a toll on their performance. 
                </p>
                <p>One of the most influential factors that play into Pakistan’s performance in the ODI is that of the reigning power in the country. During the ceasefire violations in 2003, Pervez Musharraf continued to attempt at a resolution alongside his Indian counterpart. This was also when the number of matches played with India as the opponent Unfortunately, his term exhausted right before the attacks on the Sri Lankan National Team. The Sharif cabinet had very less motivations along the lines.With the series of unrest and a very weak and disjointed bourgeois managing the team, Pakistan started losing a lot of opportunities to engage with other countries for the sport. 
                </p>
                <p>The number of ODI matches played between in India and Pakistan post-2011 suffered hugely because of the inability of the authorities to come to a consensus within themselves as well as with the parties involved. The State priorities pushed cricket into the background. Their attempt to pull of a Pakistani version of the IPL also received a lot of trolls and the international players weren’t very keen about playing on Pakistani soil. 
                </p>
                <p>The Dawn reported earlier this July: “The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday presented its budget for the financial year 2018-19 and claimed a healthy financial position, showing an income of Rs 6.4 billion and expenses amounting Rs 5.7 billion which means a net income of Rs 700 million.” The BCCI in its 2016 report had quoted the net income at INR 1000 crores, expenditures around 500 crores. The report even boasted of newer stadiums that were built across India. 
                </p>
                <p>PCB claims to allocate PKR 2.66 billion into building infrastructure “mainly comprising stadiums in Karachi, Rawalpindi and Multan and also for cricket academies at Lahore, Multan and Karachi,” The Dawn. Though present budget allocation looks on the optimistic side, the drawbacks of being a Pakistani cricket player still overweigh the game.
